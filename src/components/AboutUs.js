<h1> WELCOME TO TSUNAMI GYM</h1>
<p>Get your desired body  using our qualified trainers and healthy meal plans offered to you by our able trainers</p>
  
  <h1 style={{color:'orangered'}}>OUR STORY</h1>
<p>Gym and Fitness was founded in 2002 as a family owned and <br/>
operated business specialising in supplying
   high-quality gym equipment at great prices.<br/>

Instead of being just another gym equipment retailer, our founders wanted to be the best in the
 industry and set their minds to doing so! Over
 the last two decades Gym and Fitness has grown into one of Kenya’s largest online fitness 
 equipment retailers, helping thousands of customers live longer, happier and healthier lives.</p>
  
  <h1 style={{color:'orangered'}}>OUR PEOPLE</h1>
<p>Gym and Fitness has a growing team of 60+ awesome superstars <br/>
and we owe our success to each and every one of them!

We have some pretty amazing people working with us, who hustle everyday <br/>
to give you the best possible experience! You can find them in areas such as sales, <br/>
marketing and e-commerce, customer service, warehousing, finance, human resources and management.

If you're looking for an opportunity to grow at a company <br/>
that's empowered, inclusive, and values great work—you should work with us.</p>
